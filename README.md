This is going to be a library for using the DLP-2232PB USB microcontroller module.

More information about the microcontroller module can be found on the [dlpdesign.com website](http://www.dlpdesign.com/usb/2232pb.shtml)

It's based on the bad code in "original/dlp2234pbg.h"

Initially, I want to add enough functionality so that I can control 1 or more stepper motors over USB using the output ports on the DLP-2232PB.

Later I will add more functionality, such as reading and writing the board's EEPROM.
